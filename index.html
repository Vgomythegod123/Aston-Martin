                <h2>Aston Martin: Vallhalla</h2>
                <p>The Aston Martin Valhalla is an upcoming sports car developed by British manufacturer Aston Martin in
                    collaboration with Red Bull Racing. The mid-engined car has a plug-in hybrid powertrain and is meant
                    to sit below the flagship Valkyrie track-focused sports car and is intended to be more usable as an
                    everyday car.
                    <br>
                    The car is a result of the collaboration between Aston Martin and Red Bull Racing. Initially called
                    AM-RB 003, the project name for the car was revealed to be the "Son of Valkyrie" at the car's public
                    introduction as it uses many technologies first implemented in the Valkyrie. The final name of the
                    car was revealed to be Valhalla. Namewise, the Valhalla follows numerous previous Aston Martin
                    models tradition of starting with the letter "V". Like the Valkyrie, the name "Valhalla" also has
                    its origin in Norse mythology.
                    <br>
                    The concept's aero design was a unique FlexFoil rear wing. The wing could change the car's downforce
                    without changing its angle of attack; it is integrated into the bodywork and is claimed to generate
                    no drag or aerodynamic turbulence.
                    <br>
                    The concept's interior has space for storing luggage behind the seats, a centre console and a phone
                    mount for the driver. The car shares the race-inspired steering wheel from the Valkyrie and features
                    unique wing shaped paddle shifters on the steering column. The car also has dihedral doors for easy
                    entry and exit. As of July 2021, the production vehicle's interior had not been publicly revealed.
                    <br>
                    The chassis is a variation of the carbon fibre monocoque chassis of the Valkyrie with the body
                    panels being produced from the same material. The chassis will be produced by Aston Martin while the
                    aerodynamic body panels will be produced at Red Bull Racing. The car is planned to weigh less than
                    1,550 kg (3,417 lb).
                    <br>
                    When initially announced, the car was planned to use a 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6 engine as opposed
                    to the V12 on the Valkyrie but would share the KERS system from the flagship sports car. A combined
                    output of those two would be around 1,000 PS (735 kW; 986 hp). The engine was intended to be
                    designed and developed in-house by the company and will use the Castrol Nexcel 90-second oil change
                    system first used in the track-only Vulcan. The car is the first road car to use such a system. The
                    exhaust system uses dual outlets which are placed on top of the car, similar to the Porsche 918
                    Spyder. However, in July 2021, the Valhalla's production form debuted and featured an extensive
                    redesign from the concept form, including switching engines from the in-house V6 to the Mercedes-AMG
                    M178 LS2 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 in conjunction with two electric motors, among many other
                    changes. The new powertrain will develop 950 PS (699 kW; 937 hp).

                <h2>Aston Martin: DBS Superleggera</h2>
                <p>The Aston Martin DBS Superleggera, also sold as the Aston Martin DBS, is a grand touring car
                    produced by British manufacturer Aston Martin since 2018. In June 2018, Aston Martin unveiled
                    the car as a replacement to the Vanquish that is based on the DB11 V12 but featuring
                    modifications that differentiate it from the DB11 lineage. The DBS name was previously used
                    for a model built from 1967 to 1972 and for the DB9-based DBS V12 between 2007 and 2012. In
                    addition, the car also uses the Superleggera name which is a reference to Carrozzeria Touring
                    Superleggera, who helped Aston Martin develop their lightest grand tourers in the 1960s and
                    1970s.
                    <br>The front of the DBS features a new front bumper with a large centre grille compared to the
                    DB11 in order for improved engine cooling along with two air extractors on the sides to cool the
                    brakes and two vents on the hood that aid in the engine cooling process. The German built
                    5.2-litre twin-turbocharged V12 engine is uprated at 725 PS (533 kW; 715 hp) at 6,500 rpm and
                    900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft) of torque from 1,800-5,000 rpm. In order to optimise the centre of
                    gravity and weight distribution, the V12 unit has been positioned as low and as far back in the
                    chassis as possible.
                    <br>
                    The DBS Superleggera features the new ZF 8HP95 transmission with a shorter final-drive ratio of
                    2.93:1, in contrast to the DB11's 2.70:1. Chassis-wise, it also comes with torque vectoring
                    and a mechanical limited slip differential for more focused track performance. The car also
                    features the same aerodynamics first seen on the DB11 including Aston Martin's innovative
                    Aeroblade system, but refines aerodynamics with an F1-inspired double-diffuser that helps the
                    car generate 397 lb (180 kg) of downforce – the highest figure ever for a series production
                    Aston Martin. A new quad-pipe titanium exhaust system ensures improved engine sound while
                    the usage of carbon fibre in major areas of the car lowers the weight down to 1,693 kg (3,732
                    lb).
                    <br>
                    The DBS Superleggera can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds, and 0–161 km/h (100
                    mph) in 6.4 seconds. The car can also accelerate from 80–161 km/h (50–100 mph) in 4.2 seconds at
                    fourth gear and can attain a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph). Three driving modes are
                    available: GT, Sport, and Sport Plus which adjust the car's responsiveness.

                <h2>Aston Martin: Formula 1</h2>
                <p>Aston Martin is a British car manufacturer that has participated in Formula One in various forms and
                    is currently racing in F1 under the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team name. The company first
                    participated in Formula One during the 1959 season where they debuted the DBR4 chassis using their
                    own engine but it failed to score any points. They continued to perform poorly through the 1960
                    season, once again failing to score any points. As a result, Aston Martin decided to leave Formula
                    One after 1960.
                    <br>
                    A commercial rebranding of Racing Point F1 Team resulted in the team's return as Aston Martin in
                    2021, utilising Mercedes power units. The team, owned by Lawrence Stroll, has Fernando Alonso and
                    Lance Stroll as their race drivers beginning with the 2023 season. The team is headquartered in
                    Silverstone.
                    <br>
                    Aston Martin first entered Formula One with the DBR4, their first open-wheel racing car. The DBR4
                    was first built and tested in 1957 but did not make its Formula One debut until 1959. This delay was
                    caused by the company prioritising the development of the DBR1 sports car, which went on to win the
                    1959 24 Hours of Le Mans. By the DBR4's world championship debut at the Dutch Grand Prix, it had
                    become outdated and struggled for pace against its competitors, with Carroll Shelby and Roy
                    Salvadori qualifying 10th and 13th respectively out of 15. Salvadori retired from the race
                    in the early laps with an engine failure, with Shelby's car suffering the same fate later in the
                    race.
                    <br>
                    The team's next entry came at the British Grand Prix where Salvadori surprised by qualifying in 2nd
                    place. Early in the race, one of Shelby's ignition magnetos failed, harming his car's pace. The
                    second magneto failed late in the race, causing his retirement. Salvadori could only hold on to 6th
                    place, narrowly missing out on a points finish. At the Portuguese Grand Prix, both cars avoided
                    issues to finish 6th and 8th but still failed to score points. Aston Martin's final entry of the
                    season was the Italian Grand Prix where both cars continued to struggle, qualifying only 17th and
                    19th. During the race, Salvadori had run as high as 7th before suffering an engine failure
                    whilst Shelby came home to finish 10th. The car was significantly outdated by its rivals and
                    failed to score any points.

                <h2>Aston Martin: V12 Roadster</h2>
                <p>The Aston Martin Vantage is a two-seater sports car built by British manufacturer Aston Martin since
                    2018. It replaces the previous model which had been in production for 12 years.
                    <br>
                    The Vantage AMR is a track-focused variant of the Vantage. The main highlight of the model is the
                    replacement of the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission with a dog-leg Graziano Trasmissioni 7-speed
                    manual transmission previously used on the V12 Vantage S. The AMR also comes with a
                    driver-selectable AMSHIFT system which controls the throttle during gear shifting. A new
                    limited-slip differential ensures linear delivery of power. The power-band of the engine is wider
                    and the unit is designed to deliver 625 N⋅m (461 lb⋅ft) of torque from 2,000 rpm to 5,000 rpm. The
                    use of a manual transmission and carbon-ceramic brakes reduce the weight by 95 kg (209 lb). New
                    adaptive dampers with the section of Sport, Sport + and Track modes improve handling. Performance
                    figures include a 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 3.9 seconds, half a second more than the
                    standard Vantage while the top speed remains the same as the standard model. Visual changes include
                    20-inch forged wheels as available on the Rapide AMR, new carbon fibre side vents and cooling vents
                    present on the hood a sports exhaust system with quad tailpipes and racing bucket seats. Production
                    of the AMR will be limited to 200 units worldwide. Available exterior colours for the AMR include
                    Sabiro Blue, Pnyx Black, China Grey and White Stone. The final 59 cars will be finished in a
                    Sterling Green exterior colour with Lime accents and will pay homage to the 1959 24 Hours of LeMans
                    victory of Aston Martin. Once the production of the AMR ceases, the 7-speed manual transmission will
                    become available on the standard Vantage.

                    Revealed in February 2020, the Vantage Roadster is a convertible version of the V8 Coupe with a
                    fabric roof. The roof claimed to be the fastest of any automotive automatic convertible system,
                    takes 6.7 seconds to lower and 6.8 seconds to raise and can be operated at speeds of up to 50 km/h
                    (31 mph). The Vantage Roadster has a dry weight of 1,628 kg (3,589 lb).
                    <br>
                    In March 2020, Aston Martin introduced the V12 Speedster, a production car inspired by the DBR1 of
                    the late 1950's and the 2013 CC100 concept. Aston Martin will produce 88 units at a base price of
                    $950,000. It uses a 5.2-litre twin turbo V12 based on the one from the DBS Superleggera but with
                    less power and torque. The engine sends its power to a ZF 8-speed gearbox.[15] It does the 0 to 62
                    mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 186 mph. It has 21-inch forged, center-locking wheels,
                    carbon ceramic brakes and adaptive dampers.[16] It uses a version of the Vantage roadster's bonded
                    aluminium chassis, along with most of the front-end structure of the DBS Superleggera grafted on to
                    accommodate the larger size of its V12. It has pods behind the seats that are sized to transport
                    helmets and a removeable leather bag where the glovebox would normally be.[17]

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Aston Martin’s vision is to be the world’s most desirable, ultra-luxury British brand, creating the most exquisitely addictive performance cars.   Founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford, Aston Martin is acknowledged as an iconic global brand synonymous with style, luxury, performance, and exclusivity. Aston Martin fuses the latest technology, time honoured craftsmanship and beautiful styling to produce a range of critically acclaimed luxury models including the Vantage, DB11, DBS and DBX and its first hypercar, the Aston Martin Valkyrie.   Based in Gaydon, England, Aston Martin Lagonda designs, creates and exports cars which are sold in 55 countries around the world. Its sports cars are manufactured in Gaydon with its luxury DBX SUV range proudly manufactured in St Athan, Wales.   Lagonda was founded in 1899 and Aston Martin in 1913. The two brands came together in 1947 when both were purchased by the late Sir David Brown, and the company is now listed on the London Stock Exchange as Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc.   2020 saw Lawrence Stroll become the company’s Executive Chairman, alongside significant new investment, a move that led to Aston Martin’s return to the pinnacle of motorsport with the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team and commenced new era for the iconic British marque.
